Project Name: NextWatch

Application Description: The NextWatch web app attempts to give users personalized movie/TV recommendations based on preferences. The problem this app attempts to solve is the issue of user indecisiveness when choosing their next watch and the time wasting that comes with scrolling endlessly through different platforms. The app uses a short quiz and filters like rating, language, and release year to suggest popular titles from The Movie Database.

Features + Tools/Technologies: 
Filters by genre, rating(1-10), year(range), language, and content type: HTML and JavaScript.
Movie/TV Recommendations: TMDB API.
Output content title, year, rating, description, language, genre, and image: HTML and CSS.

Timeline: 
I am working on my own for this project.
Week 1: Build basic structure, connect to TMDB API, get recommendations working.
Week 2: Add filters (rating, year, language), refine output with images, description.
Week 3:	Finalize styling, test responsiveness, get ready to submit/present.
